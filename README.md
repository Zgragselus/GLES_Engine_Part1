###### Introduction

In the introductory project it is shown how to set-up and write a very basic OpenGL ES 2.0 context within Android application. The used language is Java throughout whole lesson.

The actual code is straight forward, so let me explain it here a little bit.

###### MainActivity.java

This class is the main activity which is showed to the user. There is one private member:
```GLSurfaceView mGLView```
